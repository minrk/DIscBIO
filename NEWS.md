# Version 1.0.0

Contains several changes from the [original work](https://github.com/SystemsBiologist/PSCAN), the most relevant of which are listed below:

- Several functions have been enhanced with a `quiet` argument to suppress intermediate output (essential to obtain cleaner output in batch scripts and unit tests)
- Functions have been isolated into their own R files
- Function and package documentation were added
- Test datasets were compressed to occupy less disk space
- The accompanying [Jupyter notebook](https://hub.gke.mybinder.org/user/systemsbiologist-pscan-tza36hyq/notebooks/DIscBIO.ipynb) was integrated as a vignette
- Bugs have been fixed

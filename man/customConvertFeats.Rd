\title{Automatic Feature Id Conversion.}
\usage{
customConvertFeats(x, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data.frame or matrix including raw counts (typically, UMIs), wehre rows are 
features (genes) and rownames are feature identifiers (SYMBOLs or ENTREZIDs).}

\item{verbose}{logical, shall messages be printed to inform about conversion advances.}
}
\value{
a data.frame where rownames are ENSEMBL IDs. The new feature IDs are 
automatically imputed based on existing feature IDs (SYMBOLs or ENTREZIDs).
}
\description{
Attempt to automatically convert non-ENSEMBL feature identifiers to ENSEMBL identifiers.
Features are included as rownames of the input data.frame (or matrix). 
It is assumed that feature identifiers (i.e., rownames of x) come from human or mouse genomes, 
and are either OFFICIAL SYMBOLS or ENTREZIDS. If less than 20% of match is identified, an
error will be thrown.

\usage{
rankcols(x)
}
\description{
Ranks the elements within each col of the matrix x and returns
these ranks in a matrix
}
\note{
this function is equivalent to `samr::rankcol`, but uses `apply` to
rank the colums instead of a compiled Fortran function which was causing our
DEGanalysis functions to freeze in large datasets.

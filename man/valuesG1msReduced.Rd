\title{Single-cells data from a myxoid liposarcoma cell line}
\description{
A dataset of 30 single cells from a myxoid liposarcoma cell
  line. Columns refer to samples and rows refer to genes. The last 92 rows
  refer to external RNA controls consortium (ERCC) spike-ins. This dataset is
  part of a larger dataset containing 94 single cells. The complete dataset
  is fully compatible with this package and an rda file can be obtained at
